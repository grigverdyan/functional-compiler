How does this Assembly Interpreter/Compiler works?

This program generates 2 executable files.

    1 mode
        ./interpreter
    
            Just run it, and it works, do some inputs and see the results, it is like debugger.
            
    2 mode
        ./compiler
    
            This has 2 modes, firstly you have to compile input file, and then see the results,
            just like this:
            
        ./compiler 1 input.asm out.exe
            and to see the results, run like this:
        ./compiler 2 out.exe

P.S. Program is written on Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS

How does this Assembly Interpretator/Compiler works?

This program generates 2 executable files.
    1)  ./interpreter
            Just run it, and it works, do some inputs and see the results, it is like debugger.
    2)  ./compiler
            This has 2 modes, firstly you have to compile input file, and then see the results,
            just like this:
        ./compiler 1 input.asm out
        ./compiler 2 out

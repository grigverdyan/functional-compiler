This program generates from so-called programming language syntax an assembly file.
To execute the program, run executable, give it to input file, without path(files are in data/ directory),
and give the output file.
Program reads "program code" from input file, and writes the assembly in the output file.

Example:
    ./func_compiler.exe input.txt output.txt

P.S. Program is written on Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS
